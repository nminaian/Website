title: Design of Fuel Cell Powered UNLV Engineering Building
summary: Within MATLAB, developed a diffusion flux model using solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) to power the Science and Engineering Building (SEB) of UNLV. The designed system was comprised of a 6.4 MW dual inverter and performed at 40% efficiency at the maximum load and 48% efficiency at the typical operational load of the building (2.6 MW).
