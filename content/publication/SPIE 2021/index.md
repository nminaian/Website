abstract: The soft electroactive polymer material, ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC), has been used in several applications of soft-robotics for both its sensing and actuating capabilities. When used as a sensor, IPMCs are typically positioned in a rectangular cantilever orientation, where the produced voltage response is indicative of the displacement occurring as the IPMC is bent by an induced force. Upon changing the orientation of the IPMC sensor, alternative reproducible voltage responses occur depending upon which surface the induced force is acting upon. Herein, the effects of orientation in relation to the characteristic response of IPMCs are examined. Experiments were conducted within both an in-lab developed 85-gal drag tank with the IPMC sensor mounted to an inverted linear slide system, as well as within a Brett-type flume. The flow conditions surrounding the IPMC sensor were approximated to be at a Reynolds number range of 200 to 7000. For the three orientations tested, identified as normal, tangent, and longitudinal, distinct response shapes were readily observed. The effects of geometry are also studied, with emphasis on rectangular and cylindrical IPMCs. The results of this study can be used to optimize the designs of soft-robot devices that use IPMCs as a sensing component. Quantifying the characteristic response at varying orientations and geometries is significant to the development of an IPMC flow sensor measuring a surrounding flow field.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Book chapter discusing the current advances and implementation of the IPMC-based artificial muscles. This includes an overview of the material and fabrication techniques, examples of bioinspired actuator and sensor designs, utilization of shape memory properties and segmented electrodes for more complex actuation, as well as the application and performance of fabricated devices in underwater environments.
