• Increasing the hydrogen stoichiometric factor was found to have minimal effect on

the overall performance of the system while only decreasing the fuel efficiency.

• The oxygen stoichiometric factor played a larger role, with diminishing returns as

the value was increased.





**SOFC Design: BOP Components - Inverter**

**21**

• In order to meet the ~2600 kVA design of

the SEB, a power inverter was necessary.

• From the technical sheets, we found that

the AAB Compact Skid PVS980-CS-US

was adequate, providing up to 4000 kVA

power output through a dual inverter

system.

• The power input to this inverter setup is

6400 kW with a maximum input voltage of

1,500 V.

• The fuel cell system is designed to provide

the inverter system with its maximum

possible input when operating at 90% of the

limiting current density.





**Tubular SOFC Design by Siemens-Westinghouse**

• A tubular fuel cell design is

implemented

• The dimensions of each cell are

**Results**

• To design the stack, an operation temperature of 925 K was chosen with hydrogen

and oxygen stoichiometric factors of 1.25 and 3, respectively. The pumps operate

at 500 LPM flow rate.

• For these conditions, the model gives the following stack results:

• Under the operational load of 2,600 kVA for this same stack we get:

• The design and operation point of the fuel cell stack can be plotted over the j-V

and power curves to better illustrate the results.
